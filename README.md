scFeatureFilter is an R package that assists the identification and removal of undesired technical variability in single-cell RNAseq datasets. Our tool provides functions to explore the technical and biological variability components in the expression data, aiming to help set a threshold for the selection of features (genes, transcripts...) that are lowly affected by noise (i.e. feature filtering). Ultimately, this will help obtain more reliable biological conclusions from single-cell RNA-seq data.

# Install
At the moment, only the development version of scFeatureFilter can be installed. Use the `install_github` function in the `devtools` package (requires R version â‰¥ 3.4.2) as indicated below:
```R
